Hi, I am Jinsoo, an ICF trained coach, passionate about helping people with expat transition and financial mindfulness. 

I have been an expat myself since I left my home country, Korea, and moved to China, and then to the United States in 2011. I started out as a sales representative in finance industry and later transitioned into a software engineer in Silicon Valley. As an expat, I have overcome many hurdles in a professional environment in the United States and eventually built a successful career. However, there were times I wondered why things were not working. I know there are people out there going through the smiliar journeys. In those journeys, I want to be the light to guide people find clarity and gain confidence in their expat transition.

As I built the successful career and became a mom, I found that it was time to get my financial life together. When I first looked at my finances, I was lost. Where am I spending all this money? Through extensive research and multiple executions, I was able to not only have control over my financial life, but also change my relationship with money. If money was a source of stress before, now money has become a tool for building my happiness. That's how I started helping people align their finances with their life purpose and happiness.

In 2020, I started my coaching business after getting trained by an ICF (International Coaching Federation) accredited coaching program at Avila University to make my coaching services widely available to public.
