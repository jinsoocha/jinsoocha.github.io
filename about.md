Hi, I am Jinsoo, a Diversity Empowerment Coach, passionate about helping people gain their confidence when and where they do not feel belonged due to their perceived and actual differences.

I left my home country, Korea, and moved to China, and then to the United States in 2011. I started out as a sales representative in finance industry and later transitioned into a software engineer in Silicon Valley.

As an expat, a person of color, a woman in finance and tech industry, and a mom, I have overcome many hurdles in various personal and professional environments. There were times I wondered why things were not working as I wanted. I know there are people out there going through the smiliar journeys. In those journeys, I want to be the light to guide people find clarity and gain confidence in their career and life.

In 2020, I started my coaching business after getting trained by an ICF (International Coaching Federation) accredited coaching program at Avila University to make my coaching services widely available to public.
